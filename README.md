# SuperSingular
A collection of SAGE v8.7 notebooks that contain code either present in papers or referenced in them.
The Karatsuba notebook has code that uses 256 as its base, referenced in [Efficient algorithms for supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/413.pdf) by Craig Costello, Patrick Longa, and Michael Naehrig. The Three point montgomery ladder notebook has an implementation of the the algorithm of the same name mentioned in [Towards Quantum-Resisitant Cryptosystems  From Supersingular Elliptic Curve Isogenies](https://eprint.iacr.org/2011/506.pdf) by David Jao, Luca De Feo, and Jerome Plut. It is implemented over an elliptic curve with a j-invariant of unity over the finite field with a cardinality of 10354717741769305252977768237866805321427389645549071170116189679054678940682478846502882896561066713624553211618840202385203911976522554393044160468771151816976706840078913334358399730952774926980235086850991501872665651576831. A prime field mentioned in [NEON-SIDH: Efficient Implementation of Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol on ARM](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/669.pdf) by Brian Koziel, Amir Jalali, Reza Azaderakhsh, David Jao, Mehran Mozaffari-Kermani.
